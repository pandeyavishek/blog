A neighbour told me in high school to keep a journal to reflect on in the future. Being in high school, I nodded with her in agreement telling her I would, only to arrive here after graduating from university. As I write this post, I am preparing to move out west to Denver to start my career with the Postal Service. Throughout my time at UVA, I struggled to figure out the direction I wanted to take with my life, both in terms of my major and post-graduate plans. After much trial and error (lots of errors), I happily majored in Economics. 




Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
