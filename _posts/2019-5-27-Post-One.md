title: Hi! â€” The Journey Here
published: true

A neighbour told me in high school to keep a journal to reflect on in the future. Being in high school, I nodded with her in agreement telling her I would, only to arrive here after graduating from university. As I write this post, I am preparing to move out west to Denver to start my career with the Postal Service. Throughout my time at UVA, I struggled to figure out the direction I wanted to take with my life, both in terms of my major and post-graduate plans. After much trial and error (lots of errors), I happily majored in Economics. 

Through this blog, I hope to keep better track of my life experiences.
